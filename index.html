                            <p>Web Dev started out in the Spring of 2014, and has been working toward this point every since. The original project lead was <strong>Sam Steiner</strong>, who has since graduated. It was taken over by <strong>Michael Ziluck</strong> during the summer between the 2014 and 2015 school years. Working alongside  the other member sof the team, it has become what you see before you.</p>
							<p>What you see on your screen has been made using a combination of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>JQuery</strong>, with a sprinkle of PHP. All of the images and text has been made by Newtown High School Tech Team!</p>

                            <p>Game Dev is something that the Tech Team has been working on for a long time, and have slowly getting more and more pieces together. It has been slowly developed since early 2012, and has been expanded into a lot more. It currently is in the process of planning and programming, and a lot of work has been done on the project in recent months.</p>
                            <p>Game Dev is such a large project because it encompases almost all of the interests that people have in the club. Programming for the code. Graphics and 3-D design for the characters. Audio for the sounds. It grabs a little piece of everything, which is exactly how it is in the real world when making a game. It is a learning experience as well, as most of the people working on the project has never worked on the piece that they are working on.<p>
							<p>In order to make the game function, there needs to be a chosen programming language. Because different people in the club know different languages, we are making TWO version of the same game, in different languages, and then when it is done, we will decide as a team which is the best one to release for people to play.
							<p>A prototype should be available for download and play in the coming weeks. If you are interested in testing it, or just playing it, stay tuned for more information on what happens next!</p>

                            <h3>Preamble</h3>

	<p>Members from here on refer to people who are active in the club, and follow all expectations and requirements as defined in Article 2.</p>
	<p>Probationary Members, also known as Probies, from here on refer to people who are active in the Team but have not been voted in as a Member.</p>

<h3>Article I - Responsibilities</h3>
	<h4>Section I - Member Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Members of the Team will be expected to take responsibility for any of their own actions, including, but not limited to, directions given to Probationary Members, activity in productions, attendance to meetings, and other Team tasks they take part in. Activity in all aspects of the Technology Team must be evident: members are expected to attend both meetings a week, and required to attend at least one. If a reason is given to the Secretary prior to or within 2 days of the meeting, it will be recorded as an excused absence, and will not count toward grounds of a strike. Failure to contact the Secretary will result in the absence being marked as unexcused. After 5 unexcused absences, a strike will be brought up against the accused during the next meeting they attend. Members are required to either attend, or edit, at least one event or 5 hours worth a month depending on amount of available events. Members are also expected to be working on Personal Projects, progress on which is to be shown at select meetings. </p>

<p>Elected Positions are President, Vice President, Treasurer, Equipment Manager, Secretary, Broadcast Director, Technical Director, and Project Manager. Elections will occur no more than two months prior to the end of the school year, and any position that is not filled in the Election will be appointed within the first month of the following school year. It is the responsibility of all Members to vote on those who will fill these roles yearly. It is also the responsibility of those not in an official position to work with those who are, and follow their decisions. Should a decision be questioned, a vote may be proposed, and majority ruling within the Team will enable it to be overturned. </p>

The cleanliness and presentability of these rooms falls under the responsibility of all Members and Probationary Members, however. All members of Tech are required to follow the rules that come with the room as designated by that years executives. The room, although not being overseen by an adult must be treated as though there is one in the room. This includes, but is not limited to keeping a regular voice level, lack of profanity, no exceptions for public displays of affection, or lewd or sexual conduct. Only one non-Tech Team individual per Member/Proby present may be in the room at any given time, and no more than five  non Tech Team persons may be in the room at any time, regardless of Tech Team members in the room.</p>
<h3>Article II - Membership</h3>
	<h4>Section I - Membership Outline</h4>
<p>Membership in the Tech Team is primarily earned through trust as well as contribution and display of ability. Candidates for membership are required to work with, and contribute to, the Team, in order to be eligible for membership. A candidate will be immediately expected to begin working at becoming a Member when the Probationary Member displays their continued desire (attending two meetings) to become a part of the Tech Team.</p>
	<p>Membership is the official association of the Team with a Member. A Member will have access to B253, the resources of the Tech Team as designated by their access level, an ID card allowing them to exit out of study halls and cafeterias, and the ability to vote upon various Team decisions (including, but not limited to, the induction of new Members). </p>
	<p>A failed attempt at membership does not immediately preclude Probationary Members from subsequent attempts, except in extenuating circumstances as defined by the current President and Vice President. In the event that they are not voted in, they are given a one month trial period, after which they are able to choose to be voted on again at their discretion.</p>
	<h4>Section II - Membership Requirements</h4>
<p>It is the duty of all existing members of the Team to evaluate and observe Probationary Members in all school areas on their behavior, participation, work ethic, general participation, and any other qualities that members of the Team would require. Once a Probationary Member becomes a Member, these expectations are not dropped. In order to remain a member of the Team, they must follow the responsibilities mentioned in Article 1 Section 2  and adhere to all school rules outlined in the Student Handbook. This includes, but is not limited to, unexcused absences or tardiness in school, bullying of other students and/or staff, harassment in any form of other students and/or staff, theft, vandalism, and wearing inappropriate clothing.</p>
<h4>	Section III - Membership Expectations</h4>
<p>All Members must adhere to standards of the Tech Team in the following: professional standards of behavior and participation of events (including but not limited to Board of Education meetings, Team meetings, school-sanctioned sports events, and staff related services), upholding personal responsibilities and Team-wide responsibilities, continuous activity within the Team, and anything defined by the sitting President or Vice President as an expectation.</p>
<h3>Article III - Safety and Security</h3>
	<h4>Section I - Strike System</h4>
<p>Any Member/Probationary can bring up a strike against another Member, anonymously or otherwise. In the case of a rule violation by a Probationary Member, the prosecution may propose the punishment to the sitting President or Vice President. Strikes may be brought up based on violation of Team Policy, violation of School Rules, or if they believe it would be in the Team’s best interest. The Team may vote once both parties have made their case, however, the President may not vote; he or she resides as an impartial judge to moderate discussion and determine appropriate punishment in addition to the Strike. After a Member receives a  strike they will have their card  revoked for two weeks as a baseline. Additional punishment or  scale decided on by the team, proposed by president. When they receive their second strike they receive the punishments of first strike plus a demotion to probationary status. Third strike permanently removed from the club for the remainder for the year.</p>
	<h4>Section II - Safety and Trust</h4>
<p>All Members of the Team, including Probationary Members, represent the Team when operating at any school event or using the rooms. In addition to that, all full Members represent the Team at times other than the two aforementioned locations. Physical altercations between Team Members has a zero-tolerance policy, and successful verification of events will result in suspension of one or both parties from the Team for a period of no less than two weeks. The extent of the punishment will be determined by the sitting President or Vice President. Serious threats, especially those made in jest without obvious lack of intent, are extremely unprofessional and grounds for strikes. Haphazard equipment handling can lead to damage or loss of equipment and harm to people, thus is also grounds for a Member to be stricken. </p>

                            <p>The job of the Vice President is fairly self explanatory. The vice president's job is to be able to perform all the roles the president may in his/her absence. While the President deals often with managing with outside contacts, the Vice president mostly manages internally, making sure every member is doing their job and that there is a sense of quality control. Whatever information the president so does the vice president. As vice president is next in line he needs to be as able as the president to run meetings and the club should he be unavailable. Most of the work consists of making sure that the club is up to a standard and to make sure the club is moving in the right direction.</p>
							<p>Devin Matte is the current vice president. He has a passion for business, management and marketing. He considers himself a leader and a bit of a workaholic. He has found that his skill are heavily in video production and all things video and photography. His skills are in video but he is working on building his knowledge of audio and broadcasting.</p>
